# JavaScript: Module Import

Import sort by NPM Module, global scope, local scope. Don't need to sort by alphabet. If you're using Vue, React, or any framework, import the framework first.

Example:

```js
import { ref } from "vue";
import cloneDeep from "lodash/cloneDeep";
import dateFormat from "~/helpers/dateFormat";
import LocalComponent from "./LocalComponent.vue";
```
