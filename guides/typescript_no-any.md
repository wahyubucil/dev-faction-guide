# TypeScript: No `any`

Try not to use `any` in TypeScript. Make sure everything is always typed correctly.
If it's not, use `unknown`. `any` can be used if the type is always incorrect, and that `any` is inside a process when it's not affecting the input and output.
In input and output, must be typed correctly.
