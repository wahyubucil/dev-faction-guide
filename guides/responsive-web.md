It's better to implement mobile-first. These are media query breakpoints inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/):

| Breakpoint        | Dimensions |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Extra Small       | <576px     |
| Small             | ≥576px     |
| Medium            | ≥768px     |
| Large             | ≥992px     |
| Extra large       | ≥1200px    |
| Extra extra large | ≥1400px    |

Screen list to test:
| Breakpoint | Screens |
