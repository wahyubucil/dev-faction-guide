# React: Styling

If you want to use CSS in JS. I think nothing's here except, try to separate it from logic so the component file is not bloated.

If you want to use pure CSS or preprocessor, it's recommended to use CSS Modules, so the style would be scoped.

If you can't use CSS Modules, make sure to use a convention like BEM.
