# Working with Date

- When creating a feature filter date like filter "Tomorrow", "Next week", "Last week", etc, always rely on the client instead of the server.
- JS: It's recommended to use a date library like [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to do anything about `date`.
- UI: Use Datepicker library instead of `<input type="date">`
