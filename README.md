# Dev Faction Guide

> Faction is just another term for "Team", where it's a group of people with the same goal. It's cooler and more badass to hear. It inspired by my love for Pro Wrestling.

This repo contains guides for developers working in a *faction* on a JavaScript project. You can call it a guide, best practice, or whatever you want as long you use it to accomplish your goal of creating better software.

It will actively change, based on better practice the author or contributor learn along the way. The software development world evolves very fast, so we need to adapt fast to something new and better.

Currently, the guides don't have any exact format. As long it provides the title and the scope. The content is flexible.
